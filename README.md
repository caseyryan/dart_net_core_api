### Dart Net Core API

`Dart Net Core API` is the easiest to set up and use API server ever written Dart. The main idea, and the main difference between `Dart Net Core API` and other existing dart servers, is the maximum automation. The name and the concept was inspired by [Dotnet Core API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis). No it doesn't repeat its API or anything, it has its own. What I mean is that it has borrowed the simplicity from the Dotnet Core. I personally think that the `Dotnet Core API` is a great solution but being a `Dart` developer I want to write in `Dart` (unexpected, right?) but I also want to have the benefits that Dotnet developers have. Even if you never worked with `Dotnet Core` you will still be able to understand what I was talking about when you look at the examples below
